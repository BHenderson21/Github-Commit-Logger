This is a project I did for the Mines VEX U robotics team so we could have better, more thurough documentation of the coding work done throughout the season for our engineering notebook. However, this code could be used for any github repository.

This project must be copied into a cloned and provided the local path of the repository for which the user would like to generate logs, and then the program will pull the raw commit logs and reformat them so they are more human-readable.
